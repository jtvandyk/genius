breathing at night\nWhen you're asleep and don't know I can hear\nSounds like an angel whispering in my ear\nI don't know what I would do\nIf it wasn't for you\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause of you, I'm me\nAll

again\nBack to the seasons of my youth\nI recall a box of rags that someone gave us\nAnd how my mama put the rags to use\nThere were rags of many colors and every piece was small\nAnd I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall\nMomma sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love she made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of\nAs she sewed she told a story from the bible she had read\nAbout a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said\nPerhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness\nAnd I just couldn't wait to wear it and mama blessed it with a kiss\nMy coat of many colors that my mama made for me\nMade only from rags but I wore it so proudly\nAlthough we had money but I was rich as I could be in my coat of many colors\nMy mama made for me\nSo with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes\nIn my coat of many colors I hurried off to school\nJust to find the others laughing and a making fun of me\nIn my coat of many colors my mama made for me\nAnd oh I couldn't understand for I felt I was rich\nAnd I told them all the love my mama sewed in every stich\nAnd I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed\nAnd how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes\nBut they didn't understand and I tried to make them see\nOne is only poor only if they choose to be\nNow I know we have no money but I was rich as I could be\nIn my coat of many colors mama made for me\nMade just for me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b1dba4986f76b28763d1d9d53c893041.630x630x1.jpg", "artist": "Shania Twain", "raw":

"Back through the years I go wandering once again\nBack to the seasons of my youth\nI recall a box of rags that someone gave us\nAnd how my mama put the rags to use\nThere were rags of many colors and every piece was small\nAnd I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall\nMomma sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love she made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of\nAs she sewed she told a story from the bible she had read\nAbout a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said\nPerhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness\nAnd I just couldn't wait to wear it and mama blessed it with a kiss\nMy coat of many colors that my mama made for me\nMade only from rags but I wore it so proudly\nAlthough we had money but I was rich as I could be in my coat of many colors\nMy mama made for me\nSo with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes\nIn my coat of many colors I hurried off to school\nJust to find the others laughing and a making fun of me\nIn my coat of many colors my mama made for me\nAnd oh I couldn't understand for I felt I was rich\nAnd I told them all the love my mama sewed in every stich\nAnd I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed\nAnd how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes\nBut they didn't understand and I tried to make them see\nOne is only poor only if they choose to be\nNow I know we have no money but I was rich as I could be\nIn my coat of many colors mama made for me\nMade just for me"}}, {"title": "Come On Over", "album": "Come On Over", "year": "1999-09-06",

how you get when you're hurt to the bone\nOne too many times\nI had this heart of mine locked away\nI kept my guard up night and day\nI had enough of the games they play out there on the line\n\n[Chorus]\nIt was the crime of the century\nYou played robin hood and rescued me\nAli baba and the forty thieves\nAin't got nothing on you\nYou came on like jesse james\nYou stole my heart like you were robbing trains\nI'm gonna lock you up for life with me\nIt was the crime of the century\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou stacked the deck, you didn't gamble at all\nYou knew exactly how the cards would fall\nYou bet your heart, but as i recall\nI didn't even stand a chance\nI bet you had an ace up your sleeve\nAn' here i thought that you were so naive\nYou took my hand an' made me believe\nIn love an' real romance\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd if i live to be a hundred and one\nHoney, don't you think that it would be fun\nTo do it all over again\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nI'm gonna lock you up and throw away the key\nIt was the crime of the century\nIt was love in the third degree\nIt was the crime of the century"}}, {"title": "Dance With The One That Brought You", "album": "Shania Twain",

i'm sitting alone at a table for two\nCause he's already out on the floor\nI think about something that my mama used to say to me\n\n[Chorus]\nYou got to dance with the one that brought you\nStay with the one that want's you\nThe one who's gonna love you when all of the others go home\nDon't let the green grass fool you\nDon't let the moon get to you\nDance with the one that brought you and you can't go wrong\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe's got his old best buddies and his new best friends\nAnd all the girls give him the eye\nHe's a good time charlie and the life of the party tonight\nBut when i think about another well i don't think twice\nCause there'll never be another like him\nI know he really loves me and i think maybe mama was right\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nYou've got to dance with the one

night\nHe's a real go-getter and the best two-stepper you'll see\nBut when i'm sitting alone at a table for two\nCause he's already out on the floor\nI think about something that my mama used to say to me\n\n[Chorus]\nYou got to dance with the one that brought you\nStay with the one that want's you\nThe one who's gonna love you when all of the others go home\nDon't let the green grass fool you\nDon't let the moon get to you\nDance with the one that brought you and you can't go wrong\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe's got his old best buddies and his new best friends\nAnd all the girls give him the eye\nHe's a good time charlie and the life of the party tonight\nBut when i think about another well i don't think twice\nCause there'll never be another like him\nI know he really loves me and i think maybe mama was right\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nYou've got to dance with the one that brought you\nAnd you can't go wrong"}}, {"title": "Don't!", "album": "Greatest Hits ", "year": "2005-01-17",

1]\nDon't be stupid, you know I love you\nDon't be ridiculous, you know I need you\nDon't be absurd, you know I want you\nDon't be impossible\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)\nCan't live without you (can't live without you)\nI'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)\nSo don't be stupid, you know I love you\n\n[Verse 2]\nStop overreacting\nYou even get suspicious when I paint my nails\nIt's definitely distracting\nThe way you dramatize every little small detail\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't freak out until you know the facts\nRelax, max\n\n[Chorus 1]\nDon't be stupid, you

you (can't live without you)\nI'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)\nSo don't be stupid, you know I love you\n\n[Bridge]\nDon't be stupid\nMy baby\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)\nCan't live without you (can't live without you)\nI'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)\nSo don't be stupid, you know I love you\n\n[Chorus 1]\nDon't be stupid, you know I love you\nDon't be ridiculous, you know I need you\nDon't be absurd, you know I want you\nDon't be impossible, impossible\nOh, no, no, no\n\n[Outro]\nDon't be, don't be, don't be, baby\nDon/t be rediculous\nNo, no\nOh,

line\n\n[Verse 2]\nOnce upon a time, I let you be free\nThere was no reason that I had to feel\nI know, I know, easy for you to believe\nBut this time, it's better for me to give than

I don\u2019t know the game that well, so my mind drifted and I started writing.\u201d\n\nThere are two different versions of \u201cFrom This Moment On\u201d.

Shania Twain, Bryan White, Both]\nFrom this moment life has begun\nFrom this moment, you are the one\nRight beside you is where I belong\nFrom this moment on\nFrom this moment I have been blessed\nI live only for your happiness\nAnd for your love, I'd give my last breath\nFrom this moment on\n\n[Chorus 1: Shania Twain, Bryan White, Both]\nI give my hand to you with all my heart\nI can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start\nYou and I will never be apart\nMy dreams came true because of you\n\n[Verse 2: Shania Twain & Bryan White]\nFrom this moment, as long as I live\nI will love you, I promise you this\nThere is nothing I wouldn't give\nFrom this moment on\nOhh\n\n[Chorus 2: Shania Twain, Bryan White, Both]\nYou're the reason I believe in love\nAnd you're the answer to my prayers from up above\nAll we need is just the two of us\nMy dreams came true because of you\n\n[Verse 3: Shania Twain & Bryan White]\nFrom this moment as long as I live\nI will love you, I promise you this\nThere is nothing I wouldn't give\nFrom this moment\n\n[Outro: Shania Twain, Bryan White, Both]\nI will love you (I will love you) as long as I live\nFrom this moment on (on)\nMmm, mmm"}},

a part of me I could not hide\nAnd we'd walk and talk and touch tenderly\nThen he'd lay me down and make love to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe built a love so strong it couldn't break\nThere was not a road we were afraid to take\nAnd we'd kiss all the way from Arkansas to Rome\n'Cause in each other's arms we were home sweet home\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nBut he don't feel the same\nSince our lives became\nYears of bills, babies and chains\n\n[Chorus]\nHome ain't where his heart is anymore\nHe may hang his hat behind our bedroom door\nBut he don't lay his head down to love me like before\nHome ain't where his heart is anymore\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf foundations made of stone can turn to dust\nThen the hardest hearts of steel can turn to rust\nIf he could only find that feeling once again\nIf we could only change the way the story ends\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd he may still come home\nBut I live here alone\nThe love that built these walls is gone\n\n[Chorus]\nHome ain't where his heart is anymore\nHe may hang his hat behind our bedroom door\nBut he don't lay his head down to love me like before\n(Home)\n\n[Outro]\nHe don't lay his head down to love me like before\nHome ain't where his heart is anymore\nNo,

give her away\n\n[Hook]\nI'm gonna hold on\n'Cause what I believe in is so strong\nNo matter how long\nNo one can tell me I'm wrong\nI ain't goin' down\n\n[Chorus]\nHer smile got me through the day\nAnd every night I'd pray\nI could give her enough\nAt night, I'd lie awake and cry\nHoping we'd get by\n'Cause you can't live on love\n\n[Verse 2]\nI worked night and day to keep us goin'\nThrough the sweat and tears without her knowing\nIt was worth it just to watch her grow\nOh, oh\nAt least I was able to hold her\nWhenever she needed my shoulder\nI'm so glad I never let her go\n\n[Hook]\nOh, I'm gonna hold on\n'Cause what I believe in is so strong\nNo matter how long\nNo one can tell me I'm wrong\nI ain't goin' down\n\n[Chorus]\nHer smile got me through the years\nDried away the tears\nIt filled me with hope\nAt night, I'd lie awake and cry\nPrayed we would get by\nAnd for the courage to go, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nHer smile got me through the day\nAnd every night, I'd pray\nI could give her enough\n\n[Hook]\nI'm gonna hold on (hold on)\n'Cause what I believe in is so strong (so strong)\nNo matter how long\nNo one (no one) can tell me I'm wrong\nI ain't goin' down\nI'm gonna hold on\n'Cause what I believe in is so strong\nNo matter how long\nNo one can tell me I'm wrong\nI ain't goin' down\n\n[Outro]\nNo one can tell me I'm wrong\nI ain't goin' down"}},

take two\nIt takes two to go one way\nAnd two winds to be strong enough\nBut you can't sail on a still day\nLike two ships on a sea of love\nIf it don't take two\nNoah knew what he had to do\nOoh oh yeah\nHe sent us out in the world walking two by two\nOh\n\n[Chorus]\nIf it don't take two\nIf it don't take two\nIf it don't take two\nAnd if i'm not with you\nNo it ain't worth going through\nIf it don't take two\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt takes two hearts with one beat\nAnd it takes two to say i do\nBut the champagne won't taste sweet\nAnd the dream just won't come true\nIf it don't take two\nNoah knew what he had to do, oh yeah\nHe sent us out in the world walking two by two, me and you\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nHe sent us out in the world walking two by two\nMe and you\nBaby\n\n[Chorus][x2]"}},

yeah\nOoh, I'm jealous of the rain\n\n[Chorus 4]\nWhen the wind's in your hair (I can feel it blowing)\nThe way it blows through the air (it's so unfair)\nOh, it seems so unfair, yeah\nWhen the moons in your eyes (moon's in your eyes)\nYou seem to light up the skies (light up the skies)\nYeah, and I realize\nI'm even jealous of the moon", "image":

to go and blow it all\nSo we're shoppin' every Sunday at the mall\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll we ever want is more\nA lot more than we had before\nSo take me to the nearest store\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ka-ching!)\nCan you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)\nIt makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)\nIt's such a beautiful thing\nKa-ching! (Ka-ching!)\nLots of diamond rings (Ka-ching!)\nThe happiness it brings (Ka-ching!)\nYou'll live like a king\nWith lots of money and things\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you're broke, go and get a loan\nTake out another mortgage on your home\nConsolidate so you can afford\nTo go and spend some more when you get bored\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll we ever want is more\nA lot more than we had before\nSo take me to the nearest store\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ka-ching!)\nCan you hear it ring?

am not afraid to give my heart\nEven though it don't know I exist\n'Cause in my sleep, you hold me close in the dark\nA million times I've tasted your lips\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are the light of my

won't remember what it was like\nBefore you and I fell in love\nWe were at a knot together in this life\nHard to imagine the way it was\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are the light of my life\nMy little piece of the pie\nAmerican beauty, apple of my eye\nYou are the light of my life\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've heard people say that if they could\nDo it all over again, they never would\nIt's better to have loved someone and lost\nThan to have never loved at all\nI am not afraid to give my heart\nEven though it don't know I exist\n'Cause in my sleep, you hold me close in the dark\nA million times I've tasted your lips\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are the light of my life\nMy little piece of the pie\nAmerican beauty, apple of my eye\nYou are the light of my life\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm saving myself for you\nThere is no wait long enough\nAin't no way I'm giving up\nMaybe I'm a fool\nBut nothing makes me feel so right\nThan dreaming about you at night\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are the light of my life\nMy little piece of the pie\nAmerican beauty, apple of my eye\nYou are the light of my life\nYou are the light of my life\nMy little piece of the pie\nAmerican beauty, apple of my eye\nYou are the light of my life\nLight of

2]\nOne day we'll be sitting back, laughing all about the times\nWe were doing donuts in the parking lots and running lights\nThe time of our lives is here and now and yes, we got the power\nCause we know it all\nWe're just getting started, open hearted, having a ball\nAnd nothing but time on our side\n\n[Chorus]\nMore fun is what we need\nEveryone is on their feet\nThe weekend's here and all we

ain't got to worry\nWe're running out of light, but that's alright\nNo one needs to hurry\nMorning such a long way away\nAnd we, we got all night to play\n\n[Chorus]\nMore fun is what we

of all of our favorite songs\nWe know the words by heart and we will shout and be\nSinging along as loud as we like\nFriday night\n\n[Chorus]\nMore fun is what we need\nEveryone is on their feet\nThe weekend's here and all we want to do is be together\nGet a little crazy and forget what happens later\nWe made it through the week\nNow we're headed to the streets\nMore fun is what we need\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne day we'll be sitting back, laughing all about the times\nWe were doing donuts in the parking lots and running lights\nThe time of our lives is here and now and yes, we got the power\nCause we know it all\nWe're just getting started, open hearted, having a ball\nAnd nothing but time on our side\n\n[Chorus]\nMore fun is what we need\nEveryone is on their feet\nThe weekend's here and all we want to do is be together\nGet a little crazy and forget what happens later\nWe made it through the week\nNow we're headed to the street\n\n[Bridge]\nThe day was long but the night is young and we ain't got to worry\nWe're running out of light, but that's alright\nNo one needs to hurry\nMorning such a long way away\nAnd we, we got all night to play\n\n[Chorus]\nMore fun is what we need\nEveryone is on their feet\nThe weekend's here and all we want to do is be together\nGet a little crazy and forget what happens later\nWe made it through the week (we made it)\nNow we're headed

chasing rainbows\nBlinded by the sun\nAnd did I take for granted\nI'd be the only one?\n\n[Chorus]\nI didn't know you were so lonely\nAm I to blame for making you that way?\nDid I neglect all that mattered?\nWith my head so far above\nThe clouds I didn't see\nThat it was raining on our love\n\n[Bridge]\nI was taking all the love you had to give\nBut I was too lost in life to know\nThat without my love in return you could not live\nNow she gives the love I did not show\n\n[Chorus]\nI didn't know you were so lonely\nAm I to blame for making you that way?\nDid I neglect all that mattered?\nWith my head so far above\nThe clouds I didn't see\nThat it was raining on our love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ed76b3eccae7e323df2414f7f0787b0f.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "Shania

one?\n\n[Chorus]\nI didn't know you were so lonely\nAm I to blame for making you that way?\nDid I neglect all that mattered?\nWith my head so far above\nThe clouds I didn't see\nThat it was raining on our love\n\n[Verse 2]\nRemember when, just to feel my touch\nWas all you ever needed\nOh, it used to be enough\nRemember when love\nWas a promise we would give our lives to keep\nAnd no river ran as deep\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut was I chasing rainbows\nBlinded by the sun\nAnd did I take for granted\nI'd be the only one?\n\n[Chorus]\nI didn't know you were so lonely\nAm I to blame for making you that way?\nDid I neglect all that mattered?\nWith my head so far above\nThe clouds I didn't see\nThat it was raining on our love\n\n[Bridge]\nI was taking all the love you had to give\nBut I was too lost

tell me what this is about\nYou're doing 105 and I'm lucky that you're still alive\n\n[Chorus 3]\nHe says baby get behind the wheel\nI want to make your tires squeal\nHey baby, like to make some

thought would kill me\nHas just made me strong\nI'm still under the weather\nBut i'm over the storm\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes your memory still gets the best of me\nBut that lonely ache in my heart\nAin't as bad as it used to be\nAnd sometimes the way that i'm feeling\nInside doesn't show\nBut i know\nI'll get over you, i've just got a long way to go\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nI'm still under

you\"\nAs the words came out i heard a voice inside me say\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat made you say that\nWas it the moonlight, was it the starlight in your eyes\nWhat made you say that\nHave you been listening to your heart\nIt's too late now, you don't want to (I won't let you) take it back\nCause I know love's\nWhat made you say that\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook up to see his reaction\nAnd a smile slowly spread across his face\nHe said \"what took you so long\nThat's what i've been waiting on\nI thought you'd take forever and a day\"\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat made you say that\nWas it the moonlight, was it the

open your eyes\nEven one more time\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere do you think you're going?\nI wanna go with you, can I come too?\nNobody knows you better\nNobody loves you quite like I do\n\n[Bridge]\nI wish you the best\nOh, I hope you have it all\nBut if you should fall from grace\nI'll be waiting at the bottom for you\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere do you think you're going?\nI wanna go with you, can I come

Rita\nThe redhead down the lane\n\n[Chorus]\nWhose bed have your boots been under?\nAnd whose heart did you steal i wonder?\nThis time did it feel like thunder, baby?\nAnd who did you run to?\nAnd whose lips have you been kissing?\nAnd whose ear did you make a wish in?\nIs she the one that you've been missing, baby?\nWell whose bed have your boots been under?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI heard you've been sneaking\nAround with Jill\nAnd what about that weekend\nWith Beverly Hill\nAnd I've seen you walking\nWith long-legs Louise\nAnd you weren't just talking\nLast night with Denise\n\n[Chorus]\nWhose bed have your boots been under?\nAnd whose heart did you steal i wonder?\nThis time did it feel like thunder, baby?\nAnd who did you run to?\nAnd whose lips have you been kissing?\nAnd whose ear did you make a wish in?\nIs she the one that you've been missing, baby?\nWell whose bed have your boots been under?\n\n[Verse 3]\nCome on boots\nSo next time you're lonely\nDon't call on me\nTry the operator\nMaybe she'll be free\n\n[Chorus]\nWhose bed have your boots been under?\nAnd whose heart did you steal i wonder?\nThis time did it feel like thunder, baby?\nAnd who did you run to?\nAnd whose lips have you been kissing?\nAnd whose ear did you make a wish in?\nIs she the one that you've been missing, baby?\nWell whose bed have your boots been under?\n\n[Outro]\nI wanna know whose bed,

have your boots been under?\nAnd whose heart did you steal i wonder?\nThis time did it feel like thunder, baby?\nWhose bed have your boots been under?\n\n[Verse 1]\nDon't look so lonely\nDon't act so blue\nI know I'm not the only\nGirl you run to\nI know about Lolita\nYour little Spanish flame\nI've seen you around with Rita\nThe redhead down the lane\n\n[Chorus]\nWhose bed have your boots been under?\nAnd whose heart did you steal i wonder?\nThis time did it feel like thunder, baby?\nAnd who did you run to?\nAnd whose lips have you been kissing?\nAnd whose ear did you make a wish in?\nIs she the one that you've been missing, baby?\nWell whose bed have your boots been under?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI heard you've been sneaking\nAround with Jill\nAnd what about that weekend\nWith Beverly Hill\nAnd I've seen you walking\nWith long-legs Louise\nAnd you weren't just talking\nLast night with Denise\n\n[Chorus]\nWhose bed have your boots been under?\nAnd whose heart did you steal i wonder?\nThis time did it feel like thunder, baby?\nAnd who did you run to?\nAnd whose lips have you been kissing?\nAnd whose ear did you make a wish in?\nIs she the one that you've been missing, baby?\nWell whose bed have your boots been under?\n\n[Verse 3]\nCome on boots\nSo next time you're lonely\nDon't call on me\nTry the operator\nMaybe she'll be free\n\n[Chorus]\nWhose bed have your boots been under?\nAnd whose heart did you steal i wonder?\nThis time did it feel like thunder, baby?\nAnd who did you run to?\nAnd whose lips have you been kissing?\nAnd whose ear did you make a wish in?\nIs she the one that you've been missing, baby?\nWell whose bed have your boots been under?\n\n[Outro]\nI wanna know whose bed, baby\nWhoa baby, tell me\nWhose bed, yes i wanna know\nYou better start talking\nOr you better start walking"}}, {"title": "Who\u2019s Gonna Be Your Girl?", "album": "Now", "year": "2017-09-29", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI don't need to know just where you're going\nYou

just a little\nYoung love from an innocent one\nNo shame, it's purely noncommittal\nIt's the only way to go if you want to have fun\nKick start the rhythm, pull out on the road\nRelying on an overload\nI need some baby blues reflecting in the mirror\nTelling me all the things I want to hear\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLoved and lost, I've paid a painful cost\nFeel my love, I've reached the point of no return\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm wild and a wicked\nWild and a wicked for love\nWild and a wicked\nWild and a wicked for love\n\n[Verse 2]\nI need a guy that's full of sex appeal\nI need a guy that looks good in the red\nI want someone with a heart that I can steal\nI want someone to drive me out of my head\nTight jeans, cute and the way I might behave\nEver trouble you might say\nAll the things you said it\nOoh I want him in the back that way\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Chorus][x2]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Chorus][x2]"}}, {"title": "You Can't Buy Love", "album": "Now", "year": "2017-09-29", "lyrics": "[Verse

me\nThen i start to tremble from my head down to my feet\nI become your piece of clay to do with what you please\n\n[Chorus]\nYou lay a whole lot of love on me\nA whole lot of love on me [x2]\nLet the

way\nWe knew we'd get there someday\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey said, \"I bet they'll never make it\"\nBut just look at us holding on\nWe're still together still going strong\n\n[Chorus]\n(You're still the

get there someday\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey said, \"I bet they'll never make it\"\nBut just look at us holding on\nWe're still together still going strong\n\n[Chorus]\n(You're still the one)\nYou're still the one I run to\nThe one that I belong to\nYou're still the one I want for life\n(You're still the one)\nYou're still the one that I love\nThe only one I dream of\nYou're still the one I kiss good night\n\n[Verse 2]\nAin't nothing better\nWe beat the odds together\nI'm glad we didn't listen\nLook at what we would be missing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey said, \"I bet they'll never make it\"\nBut just look at us holding on\nWe're still together still going strong\n\n[Chorus]\n(You're still the one)\nYou're still the one I run to\nThe one that I belong to\nYou're still the one I want for life\n(You're still the one)\nYou're still the one that I love\nThe only one I dream of\nYou're still the one I kiss good night\nYou're still the one\n(You're still the one)\nYou're still the one I run to\nThe one that I belong to\nYou're still the one I want for life\n(You're still the one)\nYou're still the one that I love\nThe only one I dream of\nYou're still the one I kiss good

fighting for air\nI wanted to run, but I was already there\nCause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking\nMy mind was aching, and we were making it\n\n[Refrain]\nAnd you shook me all night long\nYou shook me all night long\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm working double-time on the seduction line\nHe was one of a kind, he was mine, all mine\nWanted no applause, it's just another course\nMade a meal outta me, and come back for more\nHad to cool me down to take another round\nNow I'm back in the ring to take another swing\nBecause the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking\nMy mind was aching, and we were making it\n\n[Refrain]\nYou shook me all night long\nYeah, you shook me all night long\nYou knocked me out, yeah\nYou, shook me all night long\nYeah, yeah, now\nYou, shook me all night

already there\nCause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking\nMy mind was aching, and we were making it\n\n[Refrain]\nAnd you shook me all night long\nYou shook me all night long\n\n[Verse

me down to take another round\nNow I'm back in the ring to take another swing\nBecause the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking\nMy mind was aching, and we were making it\n\n[Refrain]\nYou shook

he's got a cool cadillac\nWith a jacuzzi in the back I'm in, oh yeah\nCause I'm a classy little chassis\nWho's a-huntin' for a heart to win\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, but if you wanna win it\nThere's no speed limit\nJust go faster, faster, don't be slow\nRev it up, rev it up 'til your engine blows\n\n[Chorus]\nYou win my love\nYou win my soul\nYou win my heart\nYeah, you get it all\nYou win my love\nYou make my motor run\nYou win my love\nYeah, you're number one\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, I'm a crazy little lady\nYeah, the kind you just can't slow down\nOh no\nI need a '65 cylinder racy little run around town\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, but if you wanna win it\nThere's no speed limit\nJust go faster, faster, don't be slow\nRev it up, rev it up 'til your engine blows\n\n[Chorus]\nYou win my love\nYou win my soul\nYou win my heart\nYeah, you get it all\nYou win my love\nYou make my motor run\nYou win my love\nYeah, you're number one\nOh, uh oh yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nI want a heartbreak Harley\nA full of steam dream machine\nOr just a little late night\nSexy long stretch limousine\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, but if you wanna win it\nThere's no speed limit\nJust go faster, faster, don't be slow\nRev it up, rev it up 'til your engine blows\n\n[Chorus]\nYou win my love\nYou win my soul\nYou win my heart\nYeah, you get it all\nYou win my love\nYou make my motor run\nYou win my love\nYeah, you're number one\n\n[Outro]\nOh, you win my love\nYou win my love\nOh, you win my love\nYou win my love\nI said you win my love\nYou win my love\nBabe, you win my love\nI said you win my love\nYeah, you win my love\nYou win my love"}}], "artist": "Shania Twain"}
